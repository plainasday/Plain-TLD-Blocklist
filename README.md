# **Depricated. [HaGeZi's TLD blocklist](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists#most-abused-tlds---protects-against-known-malicious-top-level-domains-) is better and more frequently maintained. Recommend using his instead.** 



# Plain-TLD-Blocklist

### Purpose
This repository contains humble DNS blocklists for Top-Level Domains (TLDs) based on reputable sources. When blocking entire TLDs, there is a possibility for breakage so please deploy wisely. 

### Supported Syntax
Supported syntax includes domains (PiHole, pfblockerNG, etc.) and Adblock Plus (Adguard, Adguard Home, uBlock Origin, etc.). 

### Lists
The primary list contains only the top abused TLDs.  The extra list contains the primary list plus some of the most historically abused TLDs.  The extra list has an increased chance of interfering with legitimate web browsing. Country TLDs are not included in either list.

### Sources
Sources include Spamhaus, NextDNS, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks, and others.

### Contributing
Community feedback is most welcome.
